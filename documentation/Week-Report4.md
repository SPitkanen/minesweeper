# Week 4

This week was used to implement DSSP algorithm from the [research](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/14398552/BECERRA-SENIORTHESIS-2015.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) page 22. The program still includes the Class BotSquare that was used to test some aspects and commented code on the ProjectBot class, I will keep these as a reference untill they can be implemented into the new algorithm. This will also be the next step on the project. Additionally I created tests for all the relevant methods. The test class creates its own board which can be used to verify desired functionalities.

As I'm not familiar with Gradle, I still can't figure out how to generate jacoco and checkstyle reports, although these plugins should come with the template.

Time used ~16h
