# Week 3

Bot gets smart! kind of

This week was used to expand bots abilities to solve the game. The bot can now deduce squares based on "pairs".
If there are only two squares left adjacent to mine, and one mine to solve, this means that it can be in either one of the remaining squares.
A pair is formed from these squares and added to a list. The bot then checks on each squares if it is adjacent to these pairs.
These pairs can be used as one "block" equal to one square containing mines and thus to deduce the remaining squares' statuses.

However this task turned out to be way more difficult than I anticipated and I fell behind on schedule on testing and documentation while trying to get this function to work properly.
This has also lead to difficult to understand code, long methods and way too many loops. I have some ideas on how to make these better.
This current version of the bot can solve intermediate level most of the time and expert sometimes (as long as it does not run into a impossible situation).

Next week I will most likely work primarily on getting the testing to adequate level and make the code look nicer. Hopefully I can also figure out more efficient ways to
run my bot. Depending on how time consuming this is, the bot might not develop much, but I feel that it works fine for now.

Estimated hours this week: 20
