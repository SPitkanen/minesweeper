This project will be coded using Java.

Algorithms and data structures are subject to change, bust most likely some kind of backtracking algorithm and lists, as these were often mentioned in the [research paper](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/14398552/BECERRA-SENIORTHESIS-2015.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). The bot will get information about the squares current status. It will deduce its moves based on this information.

As this [template](https://github.com/TiraLabra/minesweeper) was already written in english, I will continue to use it as I develop the minedweeper solving bot.
