# Week 6

This week was used to write more tests and comments/javadoc on the code. Algorithm itself is virtually unchanged
from last week, but I would still want to figure out a way how to give the hints to the player without
having to create nearly identical method as the DSSP. Additionally I have expanded the documentation
on the project.

Next I will finish the documentation and polish the code a bit more.
