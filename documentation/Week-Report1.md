# Week 1

This week was used to fork the existing template from github, and set up new repository etc.
I have also read through the recommended study on minesweeper bots, but I propably have to read it again to gain better understanding about the subject.
I have not started the actual coding yet, so I am still a bit uncertain about how to approach this problem (how to choose the best algorithms etc.).
Next I will read and research the topic more, and then start the actual coding.

Estimated time used for week 1: 5h
