Week 7

This week was used to do some upgrades to the bot, testing and documentation. Bot got the ability to
find possible moves for the player with method findMoves. some testing was also created for this method.
Additionally, I wrote small guide to use the bot, but since the user only has to start the game and click buttons it is really short.

Documentation is still lacking the O-analysis

Time used 7h
