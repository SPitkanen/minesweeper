# Week 5

This week was a bit busy for me, but I was able to finalize the core functionalities for the algorithm. It is now again able to deduce squares from pairs adjacent to it.
However it currently deduces from only one square pair, not multiple. I have deleted the now unneeded classes that I used for the first iteration. 
I also broke the code into more manageable methods and added some tests. Next I will bring the testing and documentation to more adequate level. If there is enough time 
I might try to implement some way for the algorithm to deduce more possible solutions.

Estimated time used 13h
